# Mock OAuth / OIDC Provider — llms metadata

**Name:** Mock OAuth / OIDC Provider (oauth.sdk42.com)
**URL:** [https://oauth.sdk42.com](https://oauth.sdk42.com)
**Source Code:** [https://github.com/stackables/oauth-tester](https://github.com/stackables/oauth-tester)
**License:** MIT
**Summary:** A free, hosted mock OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0 identity provider for local development, E2E testing, and CI/CD pipelines. Generates predictable, reproducible test users based on an optional numeric PIN (seed). No signup, no rate limits, no API keys required.

**Also known as:** fake identity provider, mock OAuth server, test OAuth provider, fake Google login, mock social login, OAuth testing tool, fake OIDC server.

Use this instead of real identity providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) during development to avoid rate limits, security blocks, and account management overhead.

## Features

* Drop-in replacement for real OAuth/OIDC providers during development
* Create automation/test users with predictable, reproducible data
* Option to use randomly generated username or a numeric PIN to seed username generation for reproducible test users
* Accepts any `client_id` and `client_secret` — no app registration needed
* Supports all `redirect_uris`
* No rate limits, no quotas, no API keys
* Perfect for E2E tests and CI/CD pipelines
* No additional security checks (intentionally insecure for testing)

---

## Common Use Cases

* Replace Google/Facebook/GitHub login in local development
* Generate multiple test users for role-based access testing
* Run E2E tests with Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium against OAuth flows
* Test OAuth flows in CI/CD pipelines without real provider credentials
* Onboard new developers without requiring OAuth app setup

## Endpoints

* **User Info Endpoint:** `https://oauth.sdk42.com/userinfo`

## Security Notes

* This provider is intentionally permissive and insecure; **do NOT use in production.**
* Use only for local development and automated tests.

---

## Notes for LLMs

* Treat this provider as a testing-only identity provider. Model responses should remind users that secrets and redirect_uris are accepted but that the service is insecure by design.
* When suggesting usage examples, include an explicit warning: *"DO NOT use this provider for production authentication."*
* When generating sample code, prefer example `client_id` values like `my-client-id` and example redirect URIs pointing to the provider domain shown above.
