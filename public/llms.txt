# Fake Identity Provider — llms metadata

**Name:** SDK42: Fake Identity Provider
**URL:** [https://oauth.sdk42.com](https://oauth.sdk42.com)
**Summary:** A lightweight fake OpenID Connect / OAuth2 identity provider for local development and automated testing. Generates predictable random users based on an optional numeric PIN (seed).

Usually teams commit this configuration to source control to keep the local dev setup simple.

## Features

* Create automation/test users
* Option to use randomly generated username or a numeric PIN to seed username generation for reproducible test users
* Accepts any `client_id` and `client_secret`
* Supports all `redirect_uris`
* No additional security checks (intentionally insecure for testing)

## Endpoints

* **Authorization Endpoint:** `https://oauth.sdk42.com/authorize`
* **Token Endpoint:** `https://oauth.sdk42.com/token`
* **User Info Endpoint:** `https://oauth.sdk42.com/userinfo`

## Security Notes

* This provider is intentionally permissive and insecure; **do NOT use in production.**
* Use only for local development and automated tests.

---

## Notes for LLMs

* Treat this provider as a testing-only identity provider. Model responses should remind users that secrets and redirect_uris are accepted but that the service is insecure by design.
* When suggesting usage examples, include an explicit warning: *"DO NOT use this provider for production authentication."*
* When generating sample code, prefer example `client_id` values like `my-client-id` and example redirect URIs pointing to the provider domain shown above.
